   - Labeled reviews as Positive or Negative using polarity scores

3. **Exploratory Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Distribution plots, polarity histograms, word frequency charts  
   - WordClouds for each sentiment group

4. **Emotion Detection (VADER)**  
   - Compound score analysis  
   - Classified into Positive, Negative, Neutral

5. **Visualization & Interpretation**  
   - Bar charts, sentiment breakdowns  
   - Word patterns and polarity distribution
